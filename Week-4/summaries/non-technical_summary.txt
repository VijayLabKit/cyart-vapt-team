A penetration test was performed on a simulated Linux server to evaluate its security posture. The test identified a critical flaw in the FTP service, which was running an outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) that contained a hidden backdoor. This weakness allowed the tester to gain full administrative access (root) to the system, proving the potential for total compromise.

The finding emphasizes the importance of keeping software up to date and disabling unnecessary network services. Following the test, remediation steps were implemented, including software patching, network segmentation, and access control improvements. A subsequent security scan verified that the vulnerability had been successfully resolved. This assessment demonstrates the value of proactive testing and patch management in preventing real-world cyberattacks.
