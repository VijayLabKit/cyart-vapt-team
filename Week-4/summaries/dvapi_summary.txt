Enumerated DVAPI endpoints and captured authenticated requests. Using Burp Suite I exploited Broken Object Level Authorization to access /api/users and retrieved other usersâ€™ data. Fuzzed the /graphql endpoint with Postman to expose injection results. PoC screenshots saved. Recommend strict access controls, token validation, schema introspection restrictions and immediate remediation.
