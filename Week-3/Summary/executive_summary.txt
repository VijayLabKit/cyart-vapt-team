During an authorized lab assessment we identified critical vulnerabilities that could impact confidentiality and system availability. A SQL injection in the DVWA application allows an attacker to read sensitive database records; a reflected XSS can enable session theft and user impersonation. Several outdated services on the other host increase the organizationâ€™s attack surface. Recommended immediate actions are: patch affected services, implement parameterized database queries, enforce stronger passwords and access controls, sanitize all user inputs, and restrict file upload handling. These steps will significantly reduce the risk of data loss and system compromise.
